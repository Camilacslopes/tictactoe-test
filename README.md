# Tic-Tac-Toe Challenge 

## Overview

The `game.rb` file is the classic tic-tac-toe. However, the code is a mess and there are several issues that can be improved such as:

- The handling of invalid entries is bad;
- Lack of interactive messages with players.

I will add some new features like:

- Allow the player to choose the level of difficulty, today it is always on hard;
- Allow the choice of different game types (human vs. human, computer vs. computer and human vs. computer) to be possible.
